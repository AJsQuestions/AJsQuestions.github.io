### Financial ML Teaching Notebooks

Reusable Jupyter notebooks that try to make the math feel grounded:

- Visual bias–variance tradeoff
- Regularization as a form of belief‑shrinkage
- How factor models sneak into ML regressions

Built while TA‑ing at Chicago Booth and iterated in real classrooms. The goal is to leave students with code they can actually remix.
