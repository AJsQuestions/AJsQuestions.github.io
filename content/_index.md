# AJ Jena

I study **financial systems as learning machines**.

My work sits at the intersection of  
**asset pricing**, **financial econometrics**, and **machine learning**,  
where uncertainty isn’t a bug—it’s the feature.

I’m a PhD student in Finance / Management Science at UCLA Anderson.  
Previously, I worked with researchers at Harvard Business School, Chicago Booth,  
and the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore (through Jan 2025).

I like models that explain *why*,  
algorithms that fail loudly,  
and questions that don’t behave.

### Current curiosities

- Machine learning as a Bayesian belief engine for asset pricing  
- Illiquidity, information frictions, and portfolio construction  
- When equilibrium models break—and what replaces them  
- Teaching complex math without draining the soul from it
