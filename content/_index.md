I study **financial systems as learning machines**.

My work sits at the intersection of **asset pricing**, **financial econometrics**, and **machine learning**—where uncertainty isn't a bug, it's the feature.

I'm a PhD student in Finance at UCLA Anderson. Previously, I worked with researchers at Harvard Business School, Chicago Booth, and IIM Bangalore.
