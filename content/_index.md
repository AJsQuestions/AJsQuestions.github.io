I study **financial systems as learning machines**.

Finance, econometrics, and machine learning help me watch how people trade off belief, risk, and time. The most useful moments are when the model says one thing and people do another.

I'm a PhD student in Finance at UCLA Anderson. Before that, I spent time with researchers at Harvard Business School, Chicago Booth, and IIM Bangalore, learning how to chase good questions and be wrong in public without losing curiosity.

- Illiquidity, information frictions, and the ways portfolios quietly drift
- What replaces equilibrium models when their assumptions stop holding
- Teaching math in a way that keeps curiosity alive
