A living list of questions I think about:

- When does ML add information vs. amplify noise?
- Is factor discovery just structured overfitting?
- What does equilibrium mean in a non‑stationary world?
- What's the right way to communicate uncertainty without hiding behind it?
- How can we teach complex math without draining the soul from it?

I don't expect to answer all of these. Keeping them visible reminds me why research remains fun.
