# Questions

This is a living list of open questions:

- **When does ML add information vs. amplify noise?**  
- **Is factor discovery just structured overfitting?**  
- **What does equilibrium mean in a non‑stationary world?**  
- **What’s the right way to communicate uncertainty without hiding behind it?**  
- **How can we teach complex math without draining the soul from it?**

I don’t expect to answer all of these.  
Keeping them visible reminds me why research remains fun.
