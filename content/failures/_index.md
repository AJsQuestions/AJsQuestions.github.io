# Failures

Science moves forward on the shoulders of broken experiments.

Some projects that didn’t work out—and what they taught me:

- **Attempted factor zoo replication (2023)**  
  Realized that the dataset was too noisy and the model too eager.  
  Learned to be suspicious of high Sharpe ratios.

- **Reinforcement learning for trading (2022)**  
  Fun to build, impossible to explain.  
  Taught me the value of interpretability.

I share these not to discourage exploration but to normalize it.
