# Teaching

I care deeply about **how technical ideas land**.

I’ve taught and assisted courses in:  
- Financial Econometrics  
- Machine Learning in Finance  
- Decoding FinTech

My teaching style:  
- start with geometry  
- add probability  
- introduce notation last  
- never pretend confusion is stupidity

Good teaching doesn’t simplify ideas.  
It makes complexity navigable.
