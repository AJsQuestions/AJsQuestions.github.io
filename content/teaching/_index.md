I care deeply about **how technical ideas land**. If a student walks away intimidated, I've missed the point.

### Courses (TA)

- Financial Econometrics
- Decoding FinTech

---

### Approach

- Start with geometry
- Add probability
- Introduce notation last
- Never pretend confusion is stupidity
- Use code as a second language, not a crutch

Good teaching doesn't simplify ideas; it makes complexity navigable and worth the effort.
