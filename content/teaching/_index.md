I care deeply about **how technical ideas land**.

---

### Courses

- Financial Econometrics
- Decoding FinTech

---

### Approach

- Start with geometry
- Add probability
- Introduce notation last
- Never pretend confusion is stupidity

Good teaching doesn't simplify ideas—it makes complexity navigable.
