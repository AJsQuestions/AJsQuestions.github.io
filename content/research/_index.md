# Research

I’m interested in how **learning, beliefs, and markets co‑evolve**.

Rather than treating machine learning as a black box,  
I use it as a **structured belief generator** inside economic models.

## Automating Black–Litterman Beliefs with Machine Learning

**Core idea:**  
Replace subjective investor views in Black–Litterman with ML‑generated beliefs.

**Why it matters:**  
- Bridges Bayesian portfolio theory and modern prediction  
- Preserves economic structure while allowing data‑driven views  
- Produces portfolios that outperform naïve benchmarks without degenerating into pure MVO

**Methods:**  
Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Bayesian updating, constrained mean–variance optimization.

**Status:**  
Working paper (2024).

## Illiquidity, Volatility Smoothing, and Portfolio Risk

Joint work during my time at Harvard Business School.

We study how illiquid assets distort observed volatility and expected returns,  
and how classical portfolio rules fail quietly when liquidity assumptions break.

This project blends simulation, econometrics, and institutional realism.

## Real Estate Pricing and Presale Risk (India)

This project was conducted during my time at  
the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore (Oct 2024 – Jan 2025).

We study structural models of presale housing markets,  
with the goal of quantifying risk premia embedded in presale prices  
and understanding how information asymmetry shapes urban real estate markets.

### Research philosophy

I care less about *fancy models*  
and more about **models that fail informatively**.

If a method breaks, I want to know *where*, *why*, and *what that teaches us*.
