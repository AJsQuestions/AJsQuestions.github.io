My path through data science, finance, and machine learning comes from a simple question: **Who gets to understand the systems that govern wealth? (and who gets left guessing?)**

---

### Beliefs

- Research should reduce ambiguity, not inflate it
- Build tools people can interrogate

---

### Outside work

- Turning playlists into data because taste changes faster than I think
- Cleaning LaTeX more than cleaning rooms
- Long walks where half‑baked ideas become usable ones

I'm drawn to problems that are multidisciplinary, and build an appreciation for elegance in imperfect practical methodologies.
