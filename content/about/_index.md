I'm a PhD student in Finance at UCLA Anderson where I study **financial systems as learning machines**. Before that, I spent time with researchers at Harvard Business School, Chicago Booth, and IIM Bangalore, learning how to chase good questions and be wrong in public without losing curiosity.

My path through data science, finance, and machine learning comes from a simple question: **Who gets to understand the systems that govern wealth? (and who gets left guessing?)**

### Current Interests

- Statistical Learning Theory (StatML)
- Mathematical and Computational Finance (Quant)

---

### Beliefs

- Research should reduce ambiguity, not inflate it
- Build tools people can interrogate

---

### Outside work

- Turning playlists into data because taste changes faster than I think
- Cleaning LaTeX more than cleaning rooms
- Long walks where half‑baked ideas become usable ones

I'm drawn to problems that are multidisciplinary, and build an appreciation for elegance in imperfect practical methodologies.
