I come from Mumbai, India, from a family that treats education like inheritance; to be passed on over generations.

I'm a **PhD student in Finance at UCLA Anderson** where I study *applying data science principles to gain insight on financial systems*. Before that, I spent time with researchers at Harvard Business School, Chicago Booth, and IIM Bangalore, learning how to chase good questions and be wrong in public without losing curiosity.

My path through data science, finance, and machine learning is motivated by a simple question: **Who gets to understand the systems that govern wealth? (and who gets left guessing?)**

- Build tools people can interrogate

## Outside work

- Turning playlists into data because taste changes faster than I think
- Cleaning LaTeX more than cleaning rooms
- Long walks where half‑baked ideas become usable ones
