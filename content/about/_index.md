I grew up in Mumbai in a family that treated education as inheritance. Books were shared like recipes.

My path through data science, finance, and machine learning comes from a simple question: **who gets to understand the systems that govern wealth, and who gets left guessing?**

### Beliefs

- Research should reduce ambiguity, not inflate it
- Build tools people can interrogate
- If a result can't be explained over coffee, keep working

---

### Outside work

- Turning playlists into data because taste changes faster than I think
- Cleaning LaTeX more than cleaning rooms
- Long walks where half‑baked ideas become usable ones

I'm drawn to problems that sit slightly off‑center—where theory is uneasy and data talks back.
