# About

I grew up in Mumbai in a family that treated education as inheritance.

My path through data science, finance, and machine learning  
has always been motivated by one question:

**Who gets to understand the systems that govern wealth?**

I believe research should:  
- reduce ambiguity, not inflate it  
- build tools people can interrogate  
- leave breadcrumbs for the next person

Outside work, I enjoy:  
- turning playlists into datasets  
- clean LaTeX more than clean rooms  
- long walks where half‑baked ideas become usable ones

I’m drawn to problems that sit slightly off‑center—  
where theory is uneasy and data talks back.

Most recently, I worked as a Research Associate at IIM Bangalore (Oct 2024 – Jan 2025),  
before beginning my PhD at UCLA.
