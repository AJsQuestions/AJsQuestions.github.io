I grew up in Mumbai in a family that treated education as inheritance.

My path through data science, finance, and machine learning has always been motivated by one question: **Who gets to understand the systems that govern wealth?**

### Beliefs

- Research should reduce ambiguity, not inflate it
- Build tools people can interrogate
- Leave breadcrumbs for the next person

---

### Outside work

- Turning playlists into datasets
- Clean LaTeX more than clean rooms
- Long walks where half‑baked ideas become usable ones

I'm drawn to problems that sit slightly off‑center—where theory is uneasy and data talks back.
