I come from Mumbai, India, from a family that treats education like inheritance; to be passed on over generations.

I'm a **PhD student in Finance at UCLA Anderson** where I study *applying data science principles to gain insight on financial systems*. Before that, I spent time with researchers at Harvard Business School, Chicago Booth, and IIM Bangalore, and on the derivatives desk at Cboe Global Markets, learning how to chase good questions and be wrong in public without losing curiosity. Earlier, a summer at the Indian Statistical Institute gave me my first real exposure to research.

I hold an **MS in Financial Mathematics from the University of Chicago** with a concentration in Financial Data Science and an ASEAN Merit Scholarship, took Computer Science coursework at **Harvard**, and did my **BS in Data Science at SP Jain School of Global Management** across Mumbai and Sydney.

My path through data science, finance, and machine learning is motivated by a simple question: **Who gets to understand the systems that govern wealth? (and who gets left guessing?)**
