A snapshot of what I'm currently reading or puzzling over:

- Papers on adaptive priors in asset pricing and when they overreact
- Notes on Bayesian reinforcement learning in markets that never quite settle
- Books tracing how quantitative finance borrowed (and misused) ideas from other fields
- Whether I can teach martingales without scaring people off probability forever

*Updated when something actually changes my mind.*
