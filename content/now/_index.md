# Now

This page is a snapshot of what I’m currently reading or thinking about.

For example:

- Recent papers on adaptive priors in asset pricing
- Notes on Bayesian reinforcement learning in financial markets
- Books exploring the history of quantitative finance

I update this list irregularly—when something truly grabs my attention.
